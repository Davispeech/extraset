ExtraSet is an extended dataset focusing on individual differences in lipreading. It takes broadcast-level pronunciation while excluding factors such as accent and emotion limits characters to a consistent set of 3,361 Chinese characters, and includes variations in speakers and recording years. The dataset comprises lip movement videos of five speakers from CCTV News broadcasts between 2020 and 2023, resulting in 20,232 samples totaling 16.9 hours of video.  This matches the scale of the CMLR test set. All preprocessing steps align with those applied to the CMLR dataset. Sentence lengths range from 6 to 29 characters, and the five speakers are identified as IDs 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16.
